Source Program developed using : Java

Aspect Program developed using: AspectJ

Text-to-UML tool Used: PlantUML

Expected Outputs:
       1. A text file (sequence.txt) produced by the AspectJ program (used as input to the PlantUML tool, which in turn creates a UML interaction diagram).
       2. A UML interaction diagram (sequence.png) 
       
The sources have been tested with AspectJ 1.9.1
