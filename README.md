Source Program developed using : Java

Aspect Program developed using: AspectJ

Text-to-UML tool Used: PlantUML

Source File (Src) contains: 

         1. Java files (Blogger, Observer, Subject, Newsportal, Newspaper, MobileSubscriber, Test)
         
         2. AspectJ files (Instrumentator)

Expected Outputs:
